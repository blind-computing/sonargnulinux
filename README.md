# sonar gnu/linux

A distribution concentrating on accessibility!

## Important note

This is beta quality software at best!
Any releases in the releases section are most likely of alpha or beta quality and *should not* be used on a primary device!
If you are somewhat experienced with Linux, you may use these releases, but expect bugs, application crashes and speech-dispatcher configurations that don't work at all.

Project releases are hosted on [Source Forge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sonar-gnu-linux/).

### A note regarding thus

Thus wil be our installer if I manage to get it working, which I'll probably not do by my self.
If you know python and are able to fix the broken elements then please do.
You can find my fork of thus  [here](https://github.com/stas-prze/thus).
The installation goes fine until the actual installation part, while thus looks for root images.
It basically tries to search for them in the old format manjaro used instead of the newer format, So I think that's the only thing to fix, allthough there may be more issues along the road.
So if someone is a python coder and can help, please let me know.

### For the Manjaro team members

If you see this, I would kindly ask, if there is a possibility to include sonar specific packages in the official manjaro repositories.
If this is a possibility, please [email me](mailto:stasp@poczta.sytes.net) or open an issue here.

### If you can spare your free time, please help!

I would love to see this project grow, and maintaining it my self probably is possible, but I also have other things to do, so if you can contribute in any way, it would be much appreciated!

### Thanks To

* **Jonathan Nadeau**: An original creator of the sonar project. Thank you for your hard work. Unfortunately I wasn't a linux guy in like 2016/2017 so I wasn't using it, but it is the inspiration for this project, and it layed a lot of the ground-work.
* **The Manjaro team**: Thank you for your amazing distro! You have worked hard on it. I have seen how it all started, and it has really gotten better! Once again thank you for your amazing work.

And with that said, I hope you enjoy!
