# Todo

* [ ] Find and use a better installer (#1).
    * **Calamares:** Isn't currently accessible, see [this issue](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/1294) which is caused by QT failing to expose accessible objects when it's run as root.
    * **Architect:** Great installer, but not beginner-friendly. Also has navigational accessibility problems.
    * **Thus:** Best option so far, but is out-of-date and needs updating. Here is [our fork of Thus](https://github.com/stas-prze/thus).
    * **Custom Installer:** This is a backup option, and could be developed by @mcb2003.
