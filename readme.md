# sonar gnu/linux
A distribution concentrating on accessibility!
## Importand note
The distribution isn't ready yet. If you see a release in the releases section, it most likely is a beta and should *not* be used on a primary device! If you are somewhat experienced with linux you may continue, but please not blame me for not starting speech dispatcher for you in your installation! The lack of a proper gui installer is currently worked on.
## todos
* a proper gui installer to use with orca
* update sonar-release and include the updated version in packages
The installer is currently my priority.
### For the Manjaro team members
If you see this, i would kindly ask, if there is a possibility to include sonar specific packages in the official manjaro repositories. If there would be such possibility, please mail me at stasp@poczta.sytes.net or make an issue here.
### If you can spare your free time, please help!
I would love to see this project going, and maintaining it my self probably is possible, but i also have other things to do.
Considering i'm 14, i am going to school. Actually i am home schooling so i have a little more free time, but i am now going to lear more considering i have eksams this month, at the time of writing mey2020, so if you can contribute, i would be really grateful!
### Thanks to
Jhonatan Nadeau, sory if spelled your name wrong: An original creator of the sonar project. Thank you for your hard work. Unfortunately i wasn't a linux guy in like 2016/2017 so i wasn't using it, but stil thanks.
Manjaro team: Thank you for your amazing distro!
And with that sayd, i hope you enjoy!
